#Mareeba#
A framework for building browserbased peer-to-peer-networks build and used by [Petrogale](http://www.petrogale.org/)

=
The idea behind Mareeba is to build a highly flexible framework as a good starting point to build complex p2p-networks like it is done in Petrogale, where Mareeba is used to create a distributed hash table. 
So it is intended to be able to:
* change the routing-table and routing
* add own services and corresponding messages
* send/receive text-based documents (binary isn't possible yet)


But you can also use only parts out of Mareeba, for example to have a server connection which is based on WebSockets if available and otherwise on AJAX.
